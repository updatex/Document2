# 2018-10-01 to 2018-10-08
## UC1000:
1. There is UC4 upgrade on 10-03, and some jobs finished but without actual run. These issue job happens most on C_DW_CLSFD_MP_CNTNR, if user find any data missing issue for MP, you can let me know.
2. UK Connection issue. I am reaching with UK Ops team on connection issue, currently the connection issue has not been solved. I will continue follow up on this.
 
## UC1450
1. N/A. Please take care if DFP transfer has long running jobs. If any DFP related jobs run more than 24 hour, you can reset it.
 
## PET
1. clsfd_uk_categ_geo_lkp_daily_cmd.ksh: UK connection issue. We can ignore now.
2. dw_clsfd.clsfd_mobile_de_metrics.ksh: No data on eCG Hadoop, we can ignore for now.
